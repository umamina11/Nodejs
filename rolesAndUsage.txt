we need javascript on the server
client-----> server(database, business logic, authentication, input validation)
      <-----

node js is not limited to just as a server 
- it is a javascript a runtime (can execute any code on js server)
we can use it for local utility codes and build tools 
- great tool to write utility tools 
- it is used to in webdevelopment 
-it allow them to run on server( create and listen to incoming requests like the php codes and other)
-it used for all our business logics like handle requests, validate input and connect to data base
-it can also send responses( return responses such as render the HTML file or the JSON files and other)
-alternative to node js are like python, ruby, ASp.NET and many more
- for the exectution of the node code is REPL it standa for 
    - read : for reading the input from the user 
    - Evaluation : to evaluate and authenticate the user input 
    - Print : printing the results in form of output for the users
    - Loop : Again wait for the user to give input or set of instruction to perfrom the task and system will gives the output
alternative is to execute the files other than REPL
    -as it is use for real apps
    -prediction sequence of steps
